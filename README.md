## Business Intelligence as A Way of Life 

Hello, my name is **Amanda Nicholson** and I like to solve organizational and project problems. 
I have worked with technology for over 16 years, creating websites for entrepenuers, working as an intern for an IT firm in New York
and then supporting non-profit organization leaders in different industries to operate programming in efficient ways. 

I completed by Associates of Science in Business Administration with a focus in computer science in 2017 and transferred to Columbia University
for a few semesters before focusing on my own life. Now with this nanodegree in _Business Anayltics_ I look to form a business intelligence firm that
will identify key performance indicators that are falling behind for stakeholders of non-profit organizations.
